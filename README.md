## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Install the Workflow
Download and install the workflow from the latest [releases](https://github.com/chkpwd/alfred-ente-auth/releases) page.


> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Homebrew installation is not available for the Ente CLI due to an issue with the formula. When running brew test for the formula, the ente CLI fails with an error. As a result, the formula is not ready for installation via brew yet. Please use the manual installation steps outlined above. https://github.com/ente-io/ente/pull/4028

### 2. Download and Install the Ente CLI
To use the **Ente Auth** workflow, you'll need the **Ente CLI**. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. Visit the [Ente CLI releases page](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0).
2. Download the latest version for **macOS**.
3. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable with the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo mv /path/to/ente /usr/local/bin/ente
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ente
   ```

Once installed, verify that it's working by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ente version
```

### 3. Configure Your Database
To configure the Ente CLI and ensure the workflow has access to your data, you'll need to set the **export path**. This path should be the same one you configured when adding your Ente account.
