# An Alfred Workflow that uses your Ente Exports

The Ente Auth CLI does not support exporting TOTP codes. To use this project, please export TOTP codes from the Ente app and then import them into the workflow's database by selecting the export file using the "Configure Workflow" button in the workflow setup. You can import the file using the `ente import` Alfred command. Once imported, you can delete the file.

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, the workflow will take care of the import.
> In addtion, once support for exporting codes via CLI is supported, we will use that instead.
